## Lower bounds
* [Lower bounds, derived by the proposed heuristic for all problem instances (small + large dataset)](./lower_bounds_by_heuristic.md)

## DPFSP
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the small dataset for DPFSP](./DPFSP_solutions_small_dataset.md) All solutions are optimal!
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the large dataset (1-30) for DPFSP](./DPFSP_solutions_large_dataset_1-30.md) Most solutions are optimal!

## DFSP (drop the same permutation constraint for all machines of the same factory)
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the small dataset for DFSP](./DFSP_solutions_small_dataset.md) All solutions are optimal!
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the large dataset (1-30) for DFSP](./DFSP_solutions_large_dataset_1-30.md) Most solutions are optimal!
