[!NOTE]
The problem instances can be downloaded from [DPFSP.7z](./DPFSP.7z). Originally, the dataset was hosted at <http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances> which currently (28 October 2023) seems to be unavailable ([wayback link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230609010316/http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances)). A mirror of the dataset can be found at <https://cuglirui.github.io/downloads.htm>.

## Lower bounds
* [Lower bounds, derived by the proposed heuristic for all problem instances (small + large dataset)](./lower_bounds_by_heuristic.md)

## DPFSP
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the small dataset for DPFSP](./DPFSP_solutions_small_dataset.md) All solutions are optimal!
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the large dataset (1-30) for DPFSP](./DPFSP_solutions_large_dataset_1-30.md) Most solutions are optimal! (163/180)

## DFSP (drop the same permutation constraint for all machines of the same factory)
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the small dataset for DFSP](./DFSP_solutions_small_dataset.md) All solutions are optimal!
* [Solutions for all problem instances of the large dataset (1-30) for DFSP](./DFSP_solutions_large_dataset_1-30.md) Most solutions are optimal! (133/160)
